# Kubernetes Playground
1. Login to the Kubernetes playground with your Docker account and start a new session:

   * https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/
1. Add a new instance and initialize the kubernetes cluster master node:

   ```
   kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address $(hostname -i) --pod-network-cidr 10.5.0.0/16
   ```
1. Initialize the cluster networking:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/master/daemonset/kubeadm-kuberouter.yaml
   ```
1. Deploy a sample application:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/master/content/en/examples/application/nginx-app.yaml
   ```
1. Check the status of the deployment:

   ```
   kubectl get all
   ```
1. As you can see in the logs, the Service is not working. It is because the Type of the Service is Loadbalancer. This type of Service requieres cloud credentials to create a Load Balancer in the Cloud of your choice. The best way to solve this problem is to change the type of the Service. In order to do so, we first download the YAML manifest:

    ```
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/master/content/en/examples/application/nginx-app.yaml
    ```
1. Now we can modify the Service configuration with the following command:

    ```
    sed -i /LoadBalancer/d nginx-app.yaml
    ```
1. Redeploy the manifest with the changes:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f nginx-app.yaml
    ```
1. Check again the status of the deployment:

    ```
    kubectl get all
    ```
1. Now the Service has been correctly created but there is still an issue: all the Pods are in a Pending state. To troubleshoot the problem we check the events with th e following command:

    ```
    kubectl get ev
    ```
1. The latest event shows that there is a Taint that forbids the deployment of the Pods:

    ```
    0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/master: }, that the pod didn't tolerate
    ```
1. Taints are labels (or marks) applied to the nodes in order to forbid the deployment of containers. By default the master node is tainted in order to secure the cluster. To solve this situation, the easiest way is to create a worker node for the deployment. For that purpose, you will need to add a new instance and join the cluster. But you will need a token in order to join the cluster. That token was created during the installation. If you lost the token you can generate a new one running the following command on the master node:

    ```
    kubeadm token create --print-join-command
    ```
  
3. Add a new instance and join the master node pasting the previously generated token in the newly created instance:

   ```
   kubeadm join 192.168.0.13:6443 --token vz62an.xxx --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:xxx
   ```
1. Check again the status of the deployment:

   ```
   kubectl get all
   ```
1. Now all the Pods should be correctly running and the Deployment completely Ready. But the application is still not available from outside because the container network is isolated by default. In order to be able to connect to the container network from an external web browser, we need to map a port of the external host network to a port of the internal container network. To do so, we will download again the YAML manifest, modify it and redeploy it afterwards:

    ```
    rm -f nginx-app.yaml
    
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/master/content/en/examples/application/nginx-app.yaml

    sed -i s/LoadBalancer/NodePort/ nginx-app.yaml
    
    kubectl apply -f nginx-app.yaml
    ```
    
3. In order to remove the previous deployment run the following command:

   ```
   kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/master/content/en/examples/application/nginx-app.yaml
   ```

# Docker Swarm and Kubernetes

1. Create a Docker Compose file for the cluster using Docker Swarm (Docker Compose version 3):

    * https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/

    ```
    tee ${PWD}/docker-swarm.yaml 0<<EOF

    # docker run --detach --name phpinfo --network phpinfo-default --restart always --publish 8080 --user nobody:nogroup --volume ${PWD}/index.php:/data/index.php:ro --workdir /data/ index.docker.io/library/php:alpine php -f index.php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
    configs:
      phpinfo-config:
        external: false
        file: index.php
    services:
      phpinfo:
        command:
          - php
          - -f
          - index.php
          - -S
          - 0.0.0.0:8080
        configs:
          - source: phpinfo-config
            target: /data/index.php
            uid: '65534'
            gid: '65534'
            mode: 0400
        deploy:
          placement:
            constraints:
              - "node.role==worker"      
          replicas: 1
        image: index.docker.io/library/php:alpine
        ports:
          - 8080
        user: nobody:nogroup
        working_dir: /data/
    version: '3.8'

    EOF
    ```
1. Now download the index.php artifact:

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/academiaonline-org/phpinfo/main/src/index.php
    ```
1. Deploy the application with the following command:

    ```
    docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-swarm.yaml PHPINFO
    ```
1. We can scale up or down the application modifying the number of replicas in the Docker Compose manifest or with the following command:

    ```
    docker service scale PHPINFO_phpinfo=10
    ```
1. You can open a terminal inside the container for troubleshooting purposes with the following command:

    ```
    docker exec --interactive --tty PHPINFO_phpinfo.1.475n41g0f8cz99xlzhzcuee8v sh
    ```
    
3. In order to deploy the same application on a Kubernetes cluster we will need a list of independent Kubernetes manifests to create a list of independent Kubernetes objects. Instead of having a single Docker Compose manifest, we will have a collection of manifests to create the necessary Kubernets objects: Config Map, Service and Pod:

    ```

    kind: ConfigMap
