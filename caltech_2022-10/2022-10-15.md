# Troubleshooting containers:

1. View the table of processes running inside the container
    ```
    sudo docker top phpinfo-container
    ```
1. View the logs of your container:
    ```
    sudo docker logs phpinfo-container
    ```
1. Show the resources consumption statistics of the container:
    ```
    sudo docker stats phpinfo-container --no-stream
    ```
1. Show the content of the working directory:
    ```
    sudo docker exec phpinfo-container ls -l
    ```
1. Test the connection to the webserver:
    ```
    sudo docker exec phpinfo-container curl localhost:8080 -I -s
    ```
1. In order to remove the container (you will need to remove the container before creating another container with the same name):
    ```
    sudo docker rm phpinfo-container --force
    ```

# Docker networking
The Docker container is running but only accessible from inside:
```
$ sudo docker exec phpinfo-container wget localhost:8080 -O - -q --spider -S
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Host: localhost:8080
  Date: Sat, 15 Oct 2022 14:46:11 GMT
  Connection: close
  X-Powered-By: PHP/8.0.24
  Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
  
$ wget localhost:8080 -O - -q --spider -S
$ 
```
