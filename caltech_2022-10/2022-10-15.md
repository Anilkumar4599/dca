# Troubleshooting containers:

1. View the table of processes running inside the container
    ```
    sudo docker top phpinfo-container
    ```
1. View the logs of your container:
    ```
    sudo docker logs phpinfo-container
    ```
1. Show the resources consumption statistics of the container:
    ```
    sudo docker stats phpinfo-container --no-stream
    ```
1. Show the content of the working directory:
    ```
    sudo docker exec phpinfo-container ls -l
    ```
1. Test the connection to the webserver:
    ```
    sudo docker exec phpinfo-container curl localhost:8080 -I -s
    ```
1. In order to remove the container (you will need to remove the container before creating another container with the same name):
    ```
    sudo docker rm phpinfo-container --force
    ```
