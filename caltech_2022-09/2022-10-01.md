# Docker Compose vs Docker Swarm
1. Docker Compose is a Python script that works as wrapper of Docker commands:
    ```
    which docker-compose

    file /usr/bin/docker-compose 

    head /usr/bin/docker-compose
    ```
1. Docker Swarm is a feature of the Docker engine that is enabled with the following commands:

    * https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

    ```
    docker swarm init --advertise-addr $( hostname -i )
    ```
1. Check the status of the cluster with the command:

    ```
    docker node ls
    ```
