# Experimenting with Docker bridge networks
1. List the networks:

    ```
    sudo docker network ls
    ```
2. Inspect the networks in order to obtain the IP addresses:

    ```
    sudo docker inspect bridge
    
    sudo docker inspect my_bridge
    ```
1. We need to use IP adresses when communicating containers in the default bridge:

    ```
    sudo docker exec test1 ping -c 1 172.17.0.3
    ```
1. We can use Docker internal DNS resolution when connecting containers in the custom bridge:

    ```
    sudo docker exec custom1 ping -c 1 custom2
    ```
1. We can connect one container to many networks. Let us connect the test container to the custom bridge:

    ```
    sudo docker network connect my_bridge test1
    ```
1. We can use internal DNS resolution for any container in the custom bridge:

    ```
    sudo docker exec custom1 ping -c 1 test1
    ```
1. Bridges are isolated by IPtables firewall:

    ```
    sudo iptables -S -t filter | grep A.DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-2.*DROP
    ```
